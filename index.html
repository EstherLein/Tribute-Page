      <h2>Hogwarts years</h2>
      <p>Severus attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a student from 1971-1978 as a Slytherin. He excelled in the Dark Arts from an early age and invented his signature curse: Sectumsempra, as well as writing his own potions textbook.
At Hogwarts, he faced many challenges, including being bullied by fellow student James Potter (Lily's future husband) and his friends. These events, along with his difficult childhood and his unreciprocated love for Lily, made Snape a bitter and reserved individual.

      <h2>First Wizarding War (1978–1981)</h2>
      <p>After finishing his education at Hogwarts, Snape joined the Death Eaters but quickly realized the atrocities they committed were not in line with his values. Driven by love and regret, Snape approached Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, and Snape became a double agent, working as a spy within Voldemort's ranks. He was the spy responsible for informing Voldemort about the prophecy foretelling his downfall. Which took place when Voldemort tried to kill Harry Potter and the curse backfired, because of Lily (Harry's mother) giving her life creating a powerful protection. Snape spent the rest of his life protecting Harry Potter for Lily.

      <h2>Career at Hogwarts </h2>
      <p>He started his career as a Potions teacher and Head of Slytherin House, a position he held for the majority of his time at Hogwarts.

Snape was known for his exceptional knowledge and expertise in the subject. He had a strict teaching style and had high expectations of his students, often favoring those with exceptional talent and his own house and showing little tolerance for the other three houses. This, along with his stern and sometimes harsh demeanor, made him a disliked figure among students from other houses.

Snape's career took an interesting turn when he was promoted to the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. This was a significant moment for him as it was a role he desired for a long time. However, he only held the position for one year before returning to his role as the Potions teacher.

Throughout his career, Snape played a crucial but secretive role in the fight against Lord Voldemort. He was a double agent, working as a spy for the Order of the Phoenix and feeding valuable information to Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.

      <h2>Second Wizarding War (1995–1998)</h2>
      <p>During the Second Wizarding War, Severus Snape played a significant role as a double agent. He initially aligned himself with Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters, a group of wizarding supremacists, and continued to maintain his position as a teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

As the Potions Master and later Headmaster of Hogwarts, Snape used his privileged position to gather information for the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization dedicated to fighting against Voldemort. He provided valuable intelligence to the Order, including the whereabouts of Harry Potter's mentor, Albus Dumbledore, which ultimately led to Dumbledore's death by the hands of Snape. (which was part of the plan for Snape to fully gain Voldemort's trust)

Snape's true loyalty remained hidden throughout most of the war, and many believed him to be a loyal Death Eater. However, it was revealed after Snape's death that he had been working as a double agent, with the ultimate goal of protecting Harry Potter.

Snape's actions during the war were driven by his love for Lily Evans, Harry's mother, and his guilt over her death. He dedicated himself to protecting Harry, even though he held a deep hatred for Harry's father, James Potter. Snape's sacrifice and dedication to protecting Harry proved vital in the ultimate defeat of Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters.
